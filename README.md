# TEXT-TO-SPEECH-CONVERTER
A Text-to-Speech (TTS) converter is a technology that transforms written text into spoken words. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and voice synthesis, TTS reads text aloud in a human-like voice. This tool is especially beneficial for visually impaired users, language learners, and multitaskers who need audio access to information.

# OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

This Text-to-Speech (TTS) converter project allows users to input text and convert it into spoken words. Here’s a breakdown of the project features:

Text Input Area: Users can type text into a large input field labeled "Enter text here…" which is where the text-to-speech conversion begins.

Language Selection: There’s a dropdown menu to select the desired voice for the TTS output, displaying options like "Microsoft David - English (United States)." This allows for voice selection in different languages or accents.

Search Bar for Language: A search bar is available to filter languages, making it easier for users to find specific language options.

Speed Control Slider: Users can adjust the speed of the speech output, which is set to "1.0x" by default. This slider allows customization for faster or slower reading.

Voice Activation Button: A microphone icon, likely used to initiate voice-based search or dictation.

Action Buttons (Listen and Pause): The "Listen" and "Pause" buttons at the bottom control playback, allowing users to listen to the text-to-speech output and pause it if needed.

Selected Language Display: A text display below the language dropdown shows the currently selected language and voice.
